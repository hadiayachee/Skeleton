Prior to reviewing the code, I kindly request you to open the attached pptx file(auxi C# Interview). This presentation contains visual representations of both the input and output elements, offering a comprehensive overview.

I'm pleased to report that I've successfully completed all assigned tasks, including the extra tasks. However, there remains a minor issue with aligning the center due to conflicting package versions. Despite this challenge, I've still managed to write the necessary code to achieve the alignment.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification. The finalized results can be observed in the "Results" section of the pptx presentation labeled "finish demo."

Maybe when finished build the code ,when open the pptx it need to repair ,press on repair and worked normally.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.
